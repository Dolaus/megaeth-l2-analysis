# MegaETH L2 Research & Architecture Overview

This repository explores how MegaETH builds on top of the Rust-based Ethereum client (reth)
to achieve **real-time blockchain performance**.

### Key Observations
- ‚öôÔ∏è Node specialization model (Sequencers / Replicas / Provers)
- ‚ö° Parallel transaction execution for <1 ms block times
- üß† Hardware-optimized pipeline for 100k+ TPS
- üîó Integration path between reth & MegaETH‚Äôs L2 stack
- üß© Potential synergy with EigenDA for data availability

### Why This Repo
I‚Äôm documenting my notes, research, and test observations while tracking the MegaETH Labs ecosystem.  
This is a community-driven mirror for educational and analytical purposes.
